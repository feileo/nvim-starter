# nvim-starter

**This repo is supposed to used as config by NvChad users!**

- The main nvim-core repo ([feileo/nvim-core](https://github.com/feileo/nvim-core/), fork from [NvChad/NvChad](https://github.com/NvChad/NvChad)) is used as a plugin by this repo.
- So you just import its modules, like `require "nvchad.options" , require "nvchad.mappings"`
- So you can delete the .git from this repo ( when you clone it locally ) or fork it :)
